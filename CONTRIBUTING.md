# How to contribute

Before contributing, please read and adhere to the [GOV.UK Design System code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Here are some ways in which you can contribute:

## Discussing content

You can discuss content in the Design System by commenting on issues via the [issues list](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues) or [content backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/3).

Examples of useful comments include:

- questions about the component or pattern
- answers to questions posed by other contributors
- examples or demos of the component or pattern
- research relating to the component or pattern
- offers to develop a component or pattern


## Proposing new content

If you have an idea for a new style, component or pattern you can propose it by [raising an issue](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/new).

New issues will appear in the 'Proposed' column of the [content backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/3).

We'll review new issues every fortnight to check that they meet the [Design System criteria](CRITERIA.md).

Issues that meet the criteria will be moved to the 'Agreed' column on the [content backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/3).


## Developing new content

You can see who's responsible for the development of a specific component or pattern by checking the 'Assignees' section of it's issue.

If there are currently no assignees you can ask to be assigned in the comments section of the issue, or by emailing the [Design System Team](govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk). The team will contact you for more information.

Once you've been assigned to an issue it's your responsibility to progress it to the point where it can be published in the Design System.


## Publishing new content

Before something can be published in the Design System it must meet the [Design System criteria](CRITERIA.md).

If you're assigned to an issue and believe it's ready to be published, add a 'ready' label to it. The Design System Team will review any code and the Design System Working Group will review the design and guidance.
