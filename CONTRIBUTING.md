# How to contribute

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [GOV.UK Design System code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Proposing new content

If you have an idea for a new style, component or pattern you can propose it by [raising an issue](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/new).

New issues will appear in the 'Proposed' column of the [content backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/3).

We'll review new issues every fortnight to check that they meet the [Design System criteria](CRITERIA.md).

Issues that meet the criteria will be moved to the 'Agreed' column on the [content backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/3).

## Developing new content

Once an issue is in the 'Agreed' column you're free to contribute by adding comments.

Useful contributions include links to:

- examples of the component or pattern already in use on GOV.UK
- research relating to the component or pattern
- demos of components
- answers to questions posed by other contributors
