# How to contribute

Before contributing, please read and adhere to the [GOV.UK Design System code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Here are some ways in which you can contribute:

## Discussing content

You can discuss the content being developed by commenting on issues via the [issues list](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues) or [content backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/3).

Examples of useful comments include:

- questions about a component or pattern
- answers to questions from other contributors
- examples or demos of a component or pattern
- research relating to a component or pattern
- offers to develop a component or pattern


## Proposing content

If you have an idea for a new style, component or pattern you can propose it by [raising an issue](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/new).

New issues will appear in the 'Proposed' column of the [content backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/3).

The [Design System working group](WORKING_GROUP.MD) will review new issues every fortnight against the [Design System criteria](CRITERIA.md).

Issues that meet the criteria will be moved to the 'Agreed' column on the [content backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/3).


## Developing content

You can see who's responsible for the development of a component or pattern by checking the 'Assignees' section of it's issue.

If there are currently no assignees you can ask to be assigned in the comments section of the issue, or by emailing the [Design System Team](govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk). The team will contact you for more information.

If you've been assigned to an issue it's your responsibility to progress it to the point where it can be published in the Design System.


## Publishing content

If you're assigned to an issue and believe it's ready to be published, add a 'ready' label to it. The Design System Team will review the issue and work with you to prepare it for assurance by the [Design System working group](WORKING_GROUP.md).

Once the working group has assured the issue it will be published in the Design System.
