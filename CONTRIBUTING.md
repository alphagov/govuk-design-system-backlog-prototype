## Proposing a new style, component or pattern

If you have an idea for a new style, component or pattern you can propose it by [raising an issue](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/new).

We'll review new issues every fortnight to check that they meet the [Design System criteria](CRITERIA.md).

Proposals that meet the criteria will be moved to the 'Agreed' column on our [content backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/3).
