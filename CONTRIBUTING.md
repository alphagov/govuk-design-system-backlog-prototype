# How to contribute

Before contributing, please read and adhere to the [GOV.UK Design System code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

You can contribute to the development of content in the Design System by commenting on the issues in this repository, using the [issues list](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues) or [content backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/3) section. 


## Proposing new content

If you have an idea for a new style, component or pattern you can propose it by [raising an issue](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/new).

New issues will appear in the 'Proposed' column of the [content backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/3).

We'll review new issues every fortnight to check that they meet the [Design System criteria](CRITERIA.md).

Issues that meet the criteria will be moved to the 'Agreed' column on the [content backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/3).

## Developing new content

Once an issue is in the 'Agreed' column you're free to contribute by adding comments.

Examples of useful contributions include:

- examples or demos of the component or pattern
- research relating to the component or pattern
- questions about the component or pattern
- answers to questions posed by other contributors
