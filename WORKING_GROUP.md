They do this by:

- developing the [Design System criteria](CRITERIA.md)
- reviewing new proposals against those criteria
- approving new styles, components and patterns
- resolving queries escalated to them by the Design System team
- representing the needs of users from their department

The members of the working group are nominated by the departmental Heads of Design.
